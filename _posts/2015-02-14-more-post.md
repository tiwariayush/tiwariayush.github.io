title: Switching from Wordpress to Jekyll, starting with blogs using markdown
date: 2015-02-14

I was just luring over wordpress just while playing with *PhpMyAdmin* and here I am, that too on Valentine's day. And I ended up with my new blog cum portfolio running on Jekyll. 

When it comes to looking for options, Open Source has always amazed me. I confess that even after running my previous website on github pages, I was unaware of Jekyll. But one search led to another and after an hour of **sudo(s) and apt-get(s)**, I am writing my 1st blog.

Steps to start your own web blog using Jekyll are already given on [github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
Basically, open the terminal after forking and cloning the template and type

  ```
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full
  sudo gem install bundler
  sudo gem install jekyll
  build install
  bundle exec jekyll build
  bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```
Now open the browser and go to 

> [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

> Hurrah!! You blog is running
