I was playing with `wordpress` and `PhpMyAdmin` and after a while taken to decide on what to chose as a portfolio site, I took the research back to github.

When it comes to looking for anything, open source has always amazed me. I confess that even after running my previous website on github pages, I was unaware of Jekyll. But one search led to another and after just 15 minutes of playing with `Gemfile`, I am writing a blog post.

I chose the first and default Jekyll theme called [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) for my site.

Some good points for newcomers also playing with `Jekyll`: 
1. After your installation, add `CNAME` file if you already have a domain you want to point to.
2. You can rebuild the site in different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site.
3. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
